# LLM-Verse


# LLM-Powered Communication Tools

## Overview

This project leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a suite of advanced communication tools, including text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and translation capabilities. By utilizing Parler, Whisper, and Cerebras technologies, we've developed a powerful and versatile solution to enhance multilingual and multimodal interactions.

## Features

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Convert written text into natural-sounding speech
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Transcribe spoken language into written text
- **Translation**: Enable cross-lingual communication for text and speech
- **Real-time Processing**: Near-instantaneous results for immediate use
- **Multilingual Support**: Handle a wide range of languages
- **High Accuracy**: Leverage LLMs for context-aware processing
- **Customization Options**: Adjust voice characteristics and preferences
- **API Integration**: Easy integration with other applications

## Technologies Used

- **Parler**: Utilized for advanced text-to-speech capabilities
- **Whisper**: Implemented for accurate speech-to-text transcription
- **Cerebras**: Employed for high-performance language translation and processing

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-communication-tools.git
cd llm-communication-tools
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Text-to-Speech

```python
from tts_module import TextToSpeech

tts = TextToSpeech()
tts.convert("Hello, world!", output_file="hello.wav")
```

### Speech-to-Text

```python
from stt_module import SpeechToText

stt = SpeechToText()
text = stt.transcribe("audio_file.wav")
print(text)
```

### Translation

```python
from translation_module import Translator

translator = Translator()
translated_text = translator.translate("Hello", source_lang="en", target_lang="fr")
print(translated_text)
```

## Configuration

Adjust the `config.yaml` file to customize language models, voice settings, and API keys:

```yaml
tts:
  model: "parler_tts_large"
  voice: "en_US_female_1"

stt:
  model: "whisper_large"
  language: "en"

translation:
  model: "cerebras_gpt_13b"
  api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```
